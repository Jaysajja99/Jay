## Hello World 👋
My name is Shree and I build data pipelines for a living!

I am a data engineer with a master's degree in analytics and I worked on some cool Generative AI and data engineering projects!


- 💼 Hands-on experience with data migration projects between cloud data warehousing platforms (Databricks & Snowflake).
- 🔭 I’m currently figuring out the mystics of distributed computing.
- 💬 Ask me about challenges in a real time data migration project, I would love to speak about my experience.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Apache Spark and Cloud data warehousing.
- 😃 I'm excited about how GenAI can transform data engineering landscape. check my mini project [here](https://github.com/sree2798/Talk-to-a-database-using-GenAI)
